# ðŸ“Š Stock Market Analysis & Prediction  

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning modeling** on stock market data.  
The aim is to study **stock price behavior, volatility, moving averages**, and predict **future stock prices** (example: Apple Inc. - AAPL).  

 Key Insights  
- Volatility differs across companies; some stocks are more stable than others.  
- AAPLâ€™s **price prediction was reasonably accurate**, with Random Forest performing better.  
- Moving averages (7-day, 30-day) help capture trend vs. noise.  
- Distribution of returns shows that most daily returns are close to 0, but extreme spikes exist.
